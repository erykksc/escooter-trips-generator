# # Escooter-Trip Simulation Notebook
# This notebook shows a simple pipeline to generate a large number of escooter trips in a German cities
# using OSMnx and NetworkX. Each cell is prefixed with `%%` so you can copy-paste directly into a Jupyter notebook.
# The trips are modeled using the following steps:
# 1. start point and start time of every ride is chosen randomly
# 2. The route traverses through nodes in a direction of a random bearing, choosing nodes with the smallest bearing difference
# 3. The speed between the nodes along the trip is modeled with a uniform distribution between 10-20km/h (as 20 is max legal speed in germany)
# 4. Using the speed and the distance between the nodes, the time to travel between the nodes is computed
# 5. Using the route, timestart, and time to travel between nodes of the route, the single trips representing the position and time are generated
#   * those trips are representing the shared escooter reporting during trip
#   * those trips are exported in CSV format to "escooter_trips.csv"
